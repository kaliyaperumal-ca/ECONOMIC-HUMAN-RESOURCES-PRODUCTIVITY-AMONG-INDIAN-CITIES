# ECONOMIC-HUMAN-RESOURCES-PRODUCTIVITY-AMONG-INDIAN-CITIES

Project Objectives:

The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive data-driven analysis of the economic growth, employment trends, and innovation activity across major Indian cities from 2019 to 2023, with a focus on the following goals:

Assess the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) performance of Indian cities over the 5-year period, identifying top contributing cities and analyzing sector-wise distribution among services, industry, and technology.

Evaluate employment dynamics across key sectors including SMEs, ICT, and tourism, while tracking trends in overall and youth employment/unemployment rates at the city and national levels.

Analyze investment in Research & Development (R&D) and its impact on innovation outcomes, particularly patent creation, to understand city-level contributions and year-wise trends.

Identify growth patterns and turning points, such as the sharp GDP recovery after 2020, peak employment years, and the correlation between R&D spending and innovation.

Provide actionable insights to policymakers, urban planners, and economic strategists for improving GDP contribution, enhancing employment opportunities, and fostering a stronger innovation ecosystem across Indian cities.

Questions for analysis(KPI):

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) KPIs:

What is the total GDP contributed by Indian cities between 2019 and 2023?

Which top 5 cities contributed the most to GDP over the period?

What is the percentage contribution of each sector (Services, Industry, Technology) to total GDP?

Which year recorded the lowest GDP, and what was the percentage growth in the following year?

What is the average GDP of Indian cities from 2019–2023?

Employment KPIs:

What is the sector-wise contribution to total employment across Indian cities?

Which top 5 cities have the highest unemployment rates?

In which year were employment and youth employment rates the highest?

What were the peak unemployment and youth unemployment rates, and in which years?

Which city reported the highest youth unemployment rate?

Research & Development (R&D) KPIs

Which cities ranked top 5 in R&D spending during the analysis period?

Which year saw the highest R&D spending and corresponding patent creation rate?

What was the lowest R&D spending year and its percentage share?

Which cities have the highest patents per 100,000 inhabitants?

Which city recorded the lowest patent rate per 100,000 inhabitants?

Process:

Step 1: Data Collection & Preparation Gather structured datasets on:

City-wise GDP (2019–2023) Sectoral GDP split (Services, Industry, Technology) Employment metrics (Total, Youth, Unemployment by city/sector) R&D spending and patent data per city Clean, validate, and format the data for consistency (e.g., units in billions, percentages, city names).

Step 2: KPI Definition & Setup

creating clear KPIs aligned with project objectives, such as: Total GDP and growth rate Sector-wise GDP % share Employment and unemployment % by year and city R&D investment % and patent density

Step 3: Descriptive & Comparative Analysis

Comparing city-wise GDP and sector shares Track annual GDP growth trends and identify dips/spikes Rank cities by unemployment, youth employment, and R&D spend Correlate R&D investment with patent output Highlight outliers

Step 4: Visualizations & KPI Dashboards

Create visual dashboards for: GDP trends Employment distribution R&D spend vs. patent output City rankings Include filters

Step 5: Insight Generation & Reporting

Summarize trends, patterns, and anomalies Insights according to the given data

Conclusion:

Between 2019–2023, Indian cities demonstrated steady economic progress with a total GDP of ₹24.91k billion, led by Kolkata, Guwahati, and Chennai. The services sector contributed the most to GDP (43.5%), and despite a dip in 2020, the economy rebounded strongly by 2023.

SMEs were the backbone of employment (54.58%), though unemployment remained a concern in cities like Allahabad and Varanasi. Encouragingly, 2023 marked the highest employment rates.

In R&D, cities like Surat and Nasik led investment, with 2020 seeing peak innovation activity, highlighting the positive impact of research funding on patent creation.

Overall, the data reflects resilient economic recovery, growing innovation, and the need for regional employment balancing.
